# Air-Purification-System
This project uses two MQ135 sensors with an Arduino to measure air quality before and after purification. It detects gases like Alcohol, Toluene, and Acetone, calculates how much each is reduced, and displays the purification efficiency in real time via the Serial Monitor.
